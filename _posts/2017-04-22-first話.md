Adversarial Generator-Encoder Networks

G: Hello! This is Guguchi! On this week's young jump, Kunoi-ichi-noichi was on hiatus. What a pain. 
Nice to meet you! 

M: Hi Hi! This is Maso.  I haven't bought Young jump this week. Damn.  Kunoichi-no-ichi is that cartoon about a dude acting as female ninja right? Badass! 

G: LOL, we sound like an idiot! 
M: We are going to begin with AGE, correct?  https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02304 

G: Yes, yes, Adversarial Generator-Encoder Networks.  By the way, we are still having trouble using this markdown.  Meh. 

M: I think we got to begin with WGAN. 

G: Chill, chill, let's stay on our feet.  This paper is a paper that produced autoencoder in adversarial manner.  In particular, if g is generator and e is encoder, the goal is to train g and e in adversarial training.      

$$ \max_e \min_g  V(g,e) = KL [e(g(Z)) \|  e(X) ]  $$ 

M: Right, we make $g$ and $e$ butt against each other.  

G: Well, this confused me at first, because it made no sense to me why we had to maximize the objective function about encoder. 

M: On page2, the author claims " Below, we show how to design an adversarial game between
e and g that ensures the alignment of g(Z) = X
in the data space, while only evaluating divergences in the
latent space." So the goal is to finder the auto encoder such that two distributions are most far apart from each other in the latent space. 

G: Well, that said, what is going on about max min? 

M: I am little confused about this too, in fact. As a matter of fact, we have max-min inequality

$$\sup_{z \in Z} \inf_{w \in W} f(z,w) \leq \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{z \in Z} f(z,w)$$
