Adversarial Generator-Encoder Networks

G: Hello! This is Guguchi! On this week's young jump, Kunoi-ichi-noichi was on hiatus. What a pain. 
Nice to meet you! 

M: Hi Hi! This is Maso.  I haven't bought Young jump this week. Damn.  Kunoichi-no-ichi is that cartoon about a dude acting as female ninja right? Badass! 

G: LOL, we sound like an idiot! 
M: We are going to begin with AGE, correct?  https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02304 

G: Yes, yes, Adversarial Generator-Encoder Networks.  By the way, we are still having trouble using this markdown.  Meh. 

M: I think we got to begin with WGAN. 

G: Chill, chill, let's stay on our feed.  This paper is a paper that produced autoencoder in adversarial manner.  In particular, if $g$ is generator and $e$ is encoder, the goal is to train $g$ and $e$ in adversarial training.      

$$ \max_e \min_g  V(g,e) = KL [e(g(Z)) \|  e(X)   $$ 

M: Right, we make $g$ and $e$ butt against each other.
